# CS412 Machine Learning
 Within the scope of the Machine Learning course, we had done a term project in which we worked on ML models to predict ‘whether a tweet is political or not’ and ‘whether an account is bot or not’. Furthermore, we worked on kNN, Decision trees, Neural Network Models during homeworks.

 •	As part of the term project of Machine Learning course, tasked with predicting the political nature of tweets and identifying the presence of bot accounts in social media.
 
•	Explored and tested a variety of machine learning techniques, including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, and Neural Network Models to achieve a more reliable score. 


•	Gained hands-on experience in data analysis and model development while enhancing skills in classification tasks. The project further reinforced the understanding and practical application of machine learning algorithms in real-world scenarios.
