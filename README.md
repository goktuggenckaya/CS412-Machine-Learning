# CS412 Machine Learning
 Within the scope of the Machine Learning course, we had done a term project in which we worked on ML models to predict ‘whether a tweet is political or not’ and ‘whether an account is bot or not’. Furthermore, we worked on kNN, Decision trees, Neural Network Models during homeworks.
